# Funtastic-Friends

WELCOME!

Zwischenbericht:
  How did the first weeks of the project go?
    Initially we needed some time to get together and had some struggles to find timeslots that matched for everyone, and keeping in mind to attend our meetings. We aligned on an idea fairly quickly and had open communication and great adaptibility from all group members. We were able to set-up our stack to work with (notion task planning, figma mockup, github versioning and docu, frontend react, backend nodejs, db MongoDB) and determine who develops which tasks and looks into whcih topic.
  How is your group work going?
    After initial difficulties aligning on schedules and showing up to the meetings the group work is now going well.
  Have you faced any challenges? How did you find a solution?
    We faced the challenges:
     - 3/4 members want to do backend -> therefore we split the backend into multiple sections e.g. db, registration ..
     - dropout of 1 member due to family emergency ->, as it was before the task hand-out we wished good recovery and covered the topics among the other members
     - unaligned time schedules -> when someone can not join we still go on with our meetings and alignments and cover the rest up the next time we see each other.
  What went well?
    - Agreeing on our project idea went fairly easy
    - group atmosphere is heartly welcoming and happy.
  What didn't work out as planned?
    - we all faced timely difficulties being ready with the learning sessions by project start, however that might have also to do with christmas and new years time falling in the time of studies.
  Any highlights or funny stories that happened so far?
    - no team member showed up more then 92 minutes late to a meeting
    - great to see your mentor sipping cocktails in a tshirt while being on the canary islands while its close to freezing in Hamburg ;) 
  Is there anything you would like to ask your fellow techies? Or do you have any advice?
    - stay curious.
